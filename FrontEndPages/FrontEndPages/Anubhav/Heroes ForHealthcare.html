                <u>Message from the President</u>
                <p>I started Heroes for Healthcare to help our U.S. military personnel receive the resources and credentials they need to continue their career in healthcare as a civilian.</p>
                <p>We need supporters like you to help our mission so our service members can get a job and better their lives.</p>
                <p>After all they did for us, supporting this organization seems like the right thing to do. Make a difference today by supporting Heroes for Healthcare.</p>
